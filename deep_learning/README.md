- ***[Can Neural Networks learn standard mathematical functions like Algebraic, Trigonometric and Logarithmic Functions.](./neural_network_learning_standard_mathematical_functions)*** Intuition behind neural network is to mimic a human brain. Well we have developed different Mathentical Functions over the course of history. An NN is afterall a composite funtion with lots of linear model stack inside one another. Here NNs learn about the function in its own manner as we have an accurate pattern in the generated synthetic data.

- ***Artificial Neural Networks for feature learning.*** Experimenting with the ability of neural networks to learn hidden features with a simple and well researched dataset. Neural Networks learn to do feature engineering itself on tabular dataset but still most of the time Boosting Algorithms perform better result on Tabular Dataset.
